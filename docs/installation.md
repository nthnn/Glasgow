## Installation

You can add Glasgow to your project using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Manual Integration

Clone the repository and add the Glasgow source files directly into your `.NET` project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nthnn/Glasgow.git
```

Then add the relevant `.cs` files to your project manually or using your IDE.

### Option 2: NuGet (Coming Soon)

We plan to publish Glasgow as a NuGet package for easier integration in the future. Stay tuned!
