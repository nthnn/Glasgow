## Overview

Glasgow is a flexible, modular, and lightweight .NET library designed to simplify the development of custom in-memory databases, data manipulation engines, and query interpreters. Whether you're building a data-driven application, prototyping a DSL, or implementing a custom query language, Glasgow provides the core infrastructure to parse, transform, evaluate, and manage structured data with precision and ease.

Philosophically, Glasgow is built around the extensibility and clarity. It offers utilities for expression evaluation, query parsing, sorting, filtering, projection, and dynamic typing - all tailored for scenarios where traditional relational databases may be too heavyweight or rigid. The codebase is clean, self-contained, and designed to integrate easily into both small prototypes and large-scale production systems. Glasgow is a rich expression engine that supports arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations on typed data. Paired with a compact and efficient parser and a robust evaluation pipeline, Glasgow enables developers to define and execute queries and transformations without having to build a complete query engine from scratch.

## Use Cases

- **Embedded Query Language**: Build custom data query languages for analytics dashboards, configuration engines, or scripting environments.
- **In-Memory Data Engine**: Implement dynamic, in-memory data tables that support filtering, sorting, and projection.
- **DSL Prototyping**: Rapidly prototype domain-specific languages (DSLs) that require parsing and evaluation capabilities.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Integrate Glasgow into Extract-Transform-Load pipelines for structured data filtering and transformation.
